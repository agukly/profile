        <h3>travels <img src="images/globe.gif" width="42" height="42" alt=""></h3>
        <p>Taking my backpack, getting on a plane and exploring different parts of the world is my biggest passion. I have been to more than 50 countries and still counting! When trying to give an answer to the most popular question of all time "What's your favourite country?" Well, I don't have one. It's impossible to choose a 'favourite'. I have a favourite country for Food, for Hiking, for Snorkeling, for Weather and for Shopping of course ;)</p>

        <h3>healthy habits <img class="gif" src="images/health.gif" width="110" height="53" alt=""></h3>
        <p>When travelling it's essential to prioritize healthy habits. We all know it isn't easy! No smoking, doing at least 30 minutes of exercise a day and drinking enough water are at the top of the list. Next up on the list? Yep, it's the food. Possibly the hardest part about staying healthy while traveling is avoiding diving into 'too much' local food. We've all been there, taking in the new scenery when, bam. Out of no-where a food-stand appears setting the nostrils ablaze and alighting all senses within. I mean, this is great for the first few days, but come week 2, or month number 3 and you will find yourself caught in a loop of 50c tapas.</p>

        <h3>art of packing  <img class="gif" src="images/packing.gif" width="65" height="50" alt=""></h3>
        <p>Learn how to travel light and efficient. Roll your clothes, place your shoes on the bottom, pack the inside of your shoes with as many socks as possible and throw in a couple plastic bags for any wet or dirty laundry that you will eventually have to carry around for a little bit longer than you would usually like to.</p>

        <h3>my city <img class="gif" src="images/boat.gif" width="65" height="50" alt=""></h3>
        <p>I like to promote my city <strong>Lodz</strong>: [wutɕ] because no one knows about it. It is the third-largest city in Poland and a former industrial centre. Located in the central part of the country, it has a population of 682,679 (2019). The city's coat of arms is an example of canting, as it depicts a boat (łódź in Polish), which alludes to the city's name.</p>
